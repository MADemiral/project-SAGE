Midterm weeks are given in the tentative\nschedule but may change.\n• Date for the final exam will be announced at the end of the semester. The final exam will\ncover all topics.\n• Cell phones should be turned off and kept out of sight during the classes. You are not\nalso allowed to use your computers/ tablets etc. in the classroom.\n• If you are late for more than 10 minutes, please do not enter the class.\n• You are not allowed to use cell phones during exams.\nAttendance\nYou are expected to attend all classes. Classes start on time. Show respect for your classmates\nby being on time.\nLate Assignment Submission\nFor each day after the announced deadline, 20% of the total earned mark will be deducted. More\nthan two days of late submissions will not be accepted.\nMake Up Exams\nMake-ups for midterm exams will NOT be offered generally. If you have a legitimate reason for\nmissing an exam, then you must arrange to make up the exam BEFORE the scheduled time of the\nexam. The only exceptions are illness or emergency. In case of an illness or emergency you need\nto supply documentation supporting your claim.\nFor further information, refer to University Rules and Regulations documents:\nhttps://www.tedu.edu.tr/tr/main/yonetmelikler-ve-yonergeler\nCalculator Policy\nYou may use a scientific calculator during exams. Programming the calculator before or during the\nexams is not allowed.\nPlagiarism\nAny of the following is considered as plagiarism:\n• “Turning in someone else’s work as your own\n• Copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n• Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n• Supplying incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n• Changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\nŞehram Dizeci Sep. 2022\n\n• Copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your\nwork, whether you give credit or not” (Ref. : www.plagiarism.org)\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask\nfor the help of other resources. Collaboration on non-collected homework and in studying is\nstrongly encouraged; however, the work you hand in must be solely your own. For more\ninformation on TEDU policy on intellectual integrity refer to:\nhttps://ds.tedu.edu.tr/sites/default/files/content_files/tedu_ogrenci-el-kitabi-2016.pdf\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of\nthe things that can be considered as cheating are: copying answers during exams, homeworks and\nlabs, using prohibited material on exams, lying to gain any type of advantage in class, providing\nfalse, modified or forged data in a report, plagiarizing, modifying graded material to be re-graded,\ncausing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an exam, homework or lab.\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. For more information on TEDU policy on intellectual integrity, refer to:\nhttps://ds.tedu.edu.tr/sites/default/files/content_files/tedu_ogrenci-el-kitabi-2016.pdf\nDisability Support\nIf you have a condition which may interfere with your ability to successfully attend or complete this\nmodule, please contact Dr. Onur Özmen (onur.ozmen@tedu.edu.tr).

Midterm weeks are given in the tentative\nschedule but may change.\n• Date for the final exam will be announced at the end of the semester. The final exam will\ncover all topics.\n• Cell phones should be turned off and kept out of sight during the classes. You are not\nalso allowed to use your computers/ tablets etc. in the classroom.\n• If you are late for more than 10 minutes, please do not enter the class.\n• You are not allowed to use cell phones during exams.\nAttendance\nYou are expected to attend all classes. Classes start on time. Show respect for your classmates\nby being on time.\nLate Assignment Submission\nFor each day after the announced deadline, 20% of the total earned mark will be deducted. More\nthan two days of late submissions will not be accepted.\nMake Up Exams\nMake-ups for midterm exams will NOT be offered generally. If you have a legitimate reason for\nmissing an exam, then you must arrange to make up the exam BEFORE the scheduled time of the\nexam. The only exceptions are illness or emergency. In case of an illness or emergency you need\nto supply documentation supporting your claim.\nFor further information, refer to University Rules and Regulations documents:\nhttps://www.tedu.edu.tr/tr/main/yonetmelikler-ve-yonergeler\nCalculator Policy\nYou may use a scientific calculator during exams. Programming the calculator before or during the\nexams is not allowed.\nPlagiarism\nAny of the following is considered as plagiarism:\n• “Turning in someone else’s work as your own\n• Copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n• Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n• Supplying incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n• Changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\nŞehram Dizeci Sep. 2022\n\n• Copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your\nwork, whether you give credit or not” (Ref. : www.plagiarism.org)\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask\nfor the help of other resources. Collaboration on non-collected homework and in studying is\nstrongly encouraged; however, the work you hand in must be solely your own. For more\ninformation on TEDU policy on intellectual integrity refer to:\nhttps://ds.tedu.edu.tr/sites/default/files/content_files/tedu_ogrenci-el-kitabi-2016.pdf\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of\nthe things that can be considered as cheating are: copying answers during exams, homeworks and\nlabs, using prohibited material on exams, lying to gain any type of advantage in class, providing\nfalse, modified or forged data in a report, plagiarizing, modifying graded material to be re-graded,\ncausing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an exam, homework or lab.\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. For more information on TEDU policy on intellectual integrity, refer to:\nhttps://ds.tedu.edu.tr/sites/default/files/content_files/tedu_ogrenci-el-kitabi-2016.pdf\nDisability Support\nIf you have a condition which may interfere with your ability to successfully attend or complete this\nmodule, please contact Dr. Onur Özmen (onur.ozmen@tedu.edu.tr).
