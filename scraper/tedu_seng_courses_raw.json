Mid-term [25%]\nB. Quizes [10%]\nThere will be 2 quizes.\nC. In Class Activities / Active Class Participation [5%]\nIt is encouraged that you participate in class activities and discussions. Class participation is\nawarded based on your attendance to written class activities and your contribution to class\ndiscussion.\nD. Project (25%)\nEach project will be carried out in a group, and teams must be formed with students from the\nsame section. Suggested project topics will be announced later on. Software development\nprocesses will be conducted in the project. Project hands-on works will be done/start in the\nclass. Each group will submit only one deliverable, the points of the students will differentiate\naccording to their hands-on performance in the class.\nAt the end of the semester, each group will submit a prototype/mock-up design of their project.\nThe project will be presented in the class, and presentation will be evaluated as well.\nE. Final [35%]\nThere will be one final exam including the whole topics of course.\nF. COURSERA CERTIFICATIONS ( BONUS)\nIf you obtain certificates for all three Coursera courses (stated in the recommended reading\npart), you will receive a bonus of 5 points. Partial completions will be minimally rewarded:\ncompleting only one course will earn you 1 point, while completing two courses will grant you\n3 points. To be eligible for the bonus, you must submit proof of completion (your course\ncertificates) no later than the end of Week 14.\nAdditionally, your time spent on each course will be reviewed. If your recorded learning time is\nunreasonably low (e.g., completing a 20-hour course in less than an hour), you will not receive\nthe bonus. You may also be asked to submit a short reflection or participate in a brief\ndiscussion to demonstrate your understanding before the bonus is granted.\nCOURSE POLICIES\nAttendance\nAttending is NOT mandatory, but strongly recommended. Some hands-on activities and\ndiscussions will be done in the lectures. If you would like to collect points for these activities (\nsee active class participation clause), you need to attend the lectures.\nMissed Deadline/Exam\nThere will be only one make-up exam for midterm and final exam, if the student can provide a\nlegal document confirming a health issue at the time of the exam, or with the consensus of the\nCMPE faculty. No make-up will be given for quizzes.\nLate Assignment Submission Policy\nLate submissions more than 2 days will not be graded. Each late day imposes 20% penalty of the\ntotal homework grade.\nExtra Credit\nExtra credits will not be offered.\nProject Assignment Rules\n\nAll project assignment work will be done as a group, unless told differently. Project hands-on\nwork will be done/start in the class. A group will submit only one report, the points of the\nstudents will differentiate according to their hands-on performance in the class.\nAt the end of the semester, each group will submit a mock-up prototype of their project.\n• Project Grading : Proposal: 5%, SRS : 30%, SDD : 30% , Presentation & Mock-Up: 35%\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n• turning in someone else's work as your own\n• copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n• failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n• giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n• changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n• copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your\nwork, whether you give credit or not”\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university\ndisciplinary committee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own\nbefore you ask for the help of other resources.\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of\nthe things that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n• Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n• Using prohibited material on examinations,\n• Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n• Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n• Plagiarizing.\n• Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n• Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination,\nhomework or laboratory\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university\ndisciplinary committee.\nClass Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory. The material covered in class by your instructor\nwill only provide a fundamental understanding of the general context. The reading materials will\nbe provided by the instructor on LMS, at the relevant week.\n\nTENTATIVE COURSE OUTLINE\nWeek Dates Topics Readings Assignments\n1 22.09-28.09 Introduction to Software Chapter 1\nEngineering\n2 29.09-05.10 Software Processes + IEEE 12207 Chapter 2 Form your teams\n3 06.10-12.10 Agile Development Chapter 3 Select Projects\n4 13.10-19.10 Requirements Engineering Chapter 4\n5 20.10-26.10 Assignment 1: Project\nSystem Modeling/ Class Diagrams Coursera, Software Proposals (26.10.2025)\nFlipped Class Room Engineering:\nStudy from Coursera– 2 Hours Modeling Software\nSystems using UML –\nClass Activity (in Class) : 1 hour Module 2&3 : Class\nDiagrams\n6 27.10-02.11 Requirements Modeling / Use Case Chapter 4.4, 5,\nDiagrams\nRequirements Specification\n7 03.11-09.11 System Modeling/ Sequence, Chapter 5\nActivity, State Diagrams\n8 10.11-16.11 System Modeling/ Sequence, Chapter 5 Assignment 2: SRS\nActivity, State Diagrams (16.11.2025)\nQuiz1\n(TBD)\n9 17.11-23",

The material covered in class by your instructor will\nonly provide a fundamental understanding of the general context. If you are willing to effectively learn\na topic, you must actively work on it yourself. Reading is one of the most successful ways of learning\nabout a topic.\nMissed Work\nMake ups for midterm and final exams will be provided if the student can provide a legal document\nconfirming a significant health issue at the time of the examination or with the approval of the\ninstructor.\nAssignment Rules\nAll assignment works must be done individually, unless explicitly stated in the homework assignment.\nA student can submit only one work. In case of multiple submissions, only the latest submission will\nbe considered. Students cannot submit work on other students’ behalf.\nLate Assignment Submission\nAssignments are expected to be completed by due date. For every day that the assignment is late after\ndue date, 20% of the maximum will be deducted from the assignment score. No assignments will be\naccepted once they are four or more days late.\nExtra Credits\nExtra credits will not be provided.\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n turning in someone else's work as your own\n copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n\n copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work,\nwhether you give credit or not” (www.plagiarism.org)\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask for\nthe help of other resources.\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n Using prohibited material on examinations,\n Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n Plagiarizing\n Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination, homework\nor laboratory\nCOURSE ASSIGNMENTS\nA.

Plagiarism\n“All of the following are considered plagiarism:\n turning in someone else's work as your own\n copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work,\nwhether you give credit or not” (www.plagiarism.org)\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask\nfor the help of other resources.\nVII. Cheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n Using prohibited material on examinations,\n Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n Plagiarizing\n Modifying graded material to be re-graded.\n Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination,\nhomework or laboratory.\nVIII. Class Participation\nParticipation in class is necessary but not mandatory. Some lectures require you to attend to the\nlectures to earn some points. By actively participating in class, you can improve your learning\nprocess and immediately confirm what you have learned and what you have not internalized. Do not\nforget that you are not expected to know all of the material being discussed in class. Actually, you are\nexpected not to know it. Therefore, there is no point in being hesitant to join a conversation or ask a\nquestion.\n\nIX. Class Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory. The material covered in class by your instructor\nwill only provide a fundamental understanding of the general context. If you are willing to effectively\nlearn something, you must actively work on it yourself. Reading is one of the most successful ways of\nlearning about a topic.\nX. Student Services Info\n Student Development and Psychological Counseling Center:\nStudent Development and Psychological Counseling Center conducts individual psychological\ncounseling, group psychological counseling, preventive and developmental services such as\nworkshops and seminars for all students in need. You may apply to our Center in order to deal with\nall your current problems.\nFor General Information: https://csc.tedu.edu.tr/\nFor Application: https://anket.tedu.edu.tr/index.php/761882?lang=en\n TEDU Without Barriers Unit:\nPlease inform the TEDU Without Barriers Unit and the instructor of the course about the specific\nissues in case you have a physical or mental disability and are having trouble with anything related\nto this course—such as accessing the material, participating in the class, taking notes, preparing for,\nattending or managing to complete the exams.

It is\nexpected that you attend the class on a regular basis and be on time. It is your responsibility to keep\nin touch with me about the emergencies prior to class. The TEDU policy concerning attendance will\nbe followed strictly.\nExtra Credit\nExtra credits will not be offered.\nProject Assignment Rules\nLate Assignment Submission Policy Each assignment is to be turned in on time. Arrangements for\naccepting late assignments will be made only in unusual circumstances (e.g., major illness, death of\nloved one), and only if you are able to provide documentation to support your excuse. In all other\ncases, there will be a 10% point-reduction per day for late work, and the assignment will not be\naccepted after three days late.\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n turning in someone else's work as your own\n copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n4 Computing the ECTS credits of a course: Total workload / 25 or 30 hours = ECTS credit and1 ECTS credit = 25-30 hours\n\n copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work,\nwhether you give credit or not”\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee.\nThis course adheres to the academic honesty policy. It is expected that all work submitted and\npresented by you will be your own original work and that the contributions of others will be openly\nacknowledged. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in disciplinary action. For more information:\nThe best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask for the help of\nother resources. All parties to plagiarism are considered equally guilty. If you share your coursework\nwith another student and s/he plagiarizes it, you are considered as guilty as the one who has plagiarized\nyour work since you enabled the plagiarism to take place. Under no circumstances should a student\nmake his/her coursework available to another student unless the instructor gives explicit permission\nfor this to happen. Copying someone's work is an extreme and straightforward act of plagiarism. More\ncommonly, however, students plagiarize without realizing they are doing so. This generally happens\nwhen a student fails to acknowledge the source of an idea or phrasing. Avoid plagiarism by citing\nsources properly! For all rules and requirements of APA citations, please consult the 7th edition of the\nPublication Manual of the American Psychological Association\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n Using prohibited material on examinations,\n Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n Plagiarizing.\n Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination,\nhomework or laboratory\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee.\nClass Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory.\nAnnouncements\nAnnouncements All announcements will be made on the LMS site for this course.

Mid-term [25%]\nB. Quizes [10%]\nThere will be 2 quizes.\nC. In Class Activities / Active Class Participation [5%]\nIt is encouraged that you participate in class activities and discussions. Class participation is\nawarded based on your attendance to written class activities and your contribution to class\ndiscussion.\nD. Project (25%)\nEach project will be carried out in a group, and teams must be formed with students from the\nsame section. Suggested project topics will be announced later on. Software development\nprocesses will be conducted in the project. Project hands-on works will be done/start in the\nclass. Each group will submit only one deliverable, the points of the students will differentiate\naccording to their hands-on performance in the class.\nAt the end of the semester, each group will submit a prototype/mock-up design of their project.\nThe project will be presented in the class, and presentation will be evaluated as well.\nE. Final [35%]\nThere will be one final exam including the whole topics of course.\nF. COURSERA CERTIFICATIONS ( BONUS)\nIf you obtain certificates for all three Coursera courses (stated in the recommended reading\npart), you will receive a bonus of 5 points. Partial completions will be minimally rewarded:\ncompleting only one course will earn you 1 point, while completing two courses will grant you\n3 points. To be eligible for the bonus, you must submit proof of completion (your course\ncertificates) no later than the end of Week 14.\nAdditionally, your time spent on each course will be reviewed. If your recorded learning time is\nunreasonably low (e.g., completing a 20-hour course in less than an hour), you will not receive\nthe bonus. You may also be asked to submit a short reflection or participate in a brief\ndiscussion to demonstrate your understanding before the bonus is granted.\nCOURSE POLICIES\nAttendance\nAttending is NOT mandatory, but strongly recommended. Some hands-on activities and\ndiscussions will be done in the lectures. If you would like to collect points for these activities (\nsee active class participation clause), you need to attend the lectures.\nMissed Deadline/Exam\nThere will be only one make-up exam for midterm and final exam, if the student can provide a\nlegal document confirming a health issue at the time of the exam, or with the consensus of the\nCMPE faculty. No make-up will be given for quizzes.\nLate Assignment Submission Policy\nLate submissions more than 2 days will not be graded. Each late day imposes 20% penalty of the\ntotal homework grade.\nExtra Credit\nExtra credits will not be offered.\nProject Assignment Rules\n\nAll project assignment work will be done as a group, unless told differently. Project hands-on\nwork will be done/start in the class. A group will submit only one report, the points of the\nstudents will differentiate according to their hands-on performance in the class.\nAt the end of the semester, each group will submit a mock-up prototype of their project.\n• Project Grading : Proposal: 5%, SRS : 30%, SDD : 30% , Presentation & Mock-Up: 35%\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n• turning in someone else's work as your own\n• copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n• failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n• giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n• changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n• copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your\nwork, whether you give credit or not”\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university\ndisciplinary committee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own\nbefore you ask for the help of other resources.\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of\nthe things that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n• Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n• Using prohibited material on examinations,\n• Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n• Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n• Plagiarizing.\n• Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n• Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination,\nhomework or laboratory\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university\ndisciplinary committee.\nClass Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory. The material covered in class by your instructor\nwill only provide a fundamental understanding of the general context. The reading materials will\nbe provided by the instructor on LMS, at the relevant week.\n\nTENTATIVE COURSE OUTLINE\nWeek Dates Topics Readings Assignments\n1 22.09-28.09 Introduction to Software Chapter 1\nEngineering\n2 29.09-05.10 Software Processes + IEEE 12207 Chapter 2 Form your teams\n3 06.10-12.10 Agile Development Chapter 3 Select Projects\n4 13.10-19.10 Requirements Engineering Chapter 4\n5 20.10-26.10 Assignment 1: Project\nSystem Modeling/ Class Diagrams Coursera, Software Proposals (26.10.2025)\nFlipped Class Room Engineering:\nStudy from Coursera– 2 Hours Modeling Software\nSystems using UML –\nClass Activity (in Class) : 1 hour Module 2&3 : Class\nDiagrams\n6 27.10-02.11 Requirements Modeling / Use Case Chapter 4.4, 5,\nDiagrams\nRequirements Specification\n7 03.11-09.11 System Modeling/ Sequence, Chapter 5\nActivity, State Diagrams\n8 10.11-16.11 System Modeling/ Sequence, Chapter 5 Assignment 2: SRS\nActivity, State Diagrams (16.11.2025)\nQuiz1\n(TBD)\n9 17.11-23",

No assignments will be\naccepted once they are four or more days late.\nExtra Credits\nExtra credits will not be provided.\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n turning in someone else's work as your own\n copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n\n copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work,\nwhether you give credit or not” (www.plagiarism.org)\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask for\nthe help of other resources.\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n Using prohibited material on examinations,\n Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n Plagiarizing\n Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination, homework\nor laboratory\nCOURSE ASSIGNMENTS\nA.

It is\nexpected that you attend the class on a regular basis and be on time. It is your responsibility to keep\nin touch with me about the emergencies prior to class. The TEDU policy concerning attendance will\nbe followed strictly.\nExtra Credit\nExtra credits will not be offered.\nProject Assignment Rules\nLate Assignment Submission Policy Each assignment is to be turned in on time. Arrangements for\naccepting late assignments will be made only in unusual circumstances (e.g., major illness, death of\nloved one), and only if you are able to provide documentation to support your excuse. In all other\ncases, there will be a 10% point-reduction per day for late work, and the assignment will not be\naccepted after three days late.\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n turning in someone else's work as your own\n copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n4 Computing the ECTS credits of a course: Total workload / 25 or 30 hours = ECTS credit and1 ECTS credit = 25-30 hours\n\n copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work,\nwhether you give credit or not”\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee.\nThis course adheres to the academic honesty policy. It is expected that all work submitted and\npresented by you will be your own original work and that the contributions of others will be openly\nacknowledged. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in disciplinary action. For more information:\nThe best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask for the help of\nother resources. All parties to plagiarism are considered equally guilty. If you share your coursework\nwith another student and s/he plagiarizes it, you are considered as guilty as the one who has plagiarized\nyour work since you enabled the plagiarism to take place. Under no circumstances should a student\nmake his/her coursework available to another student unless the instructor gives explicit permission\nfor this to happen. Copying someone's work is an extreme and straightforward act of plagiarism. More\ncommonly, however, students plagiarize without realizing they are doing so. This generally happens\nwhen a student fails to acknowledge the source of an idea or phrasing. Avoid plagiarism by citing\nsources properly! For all rules and requirements of APA citations, please consult the 7th edition of the\nPublication Manual of the American Psychological Association\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n Using prohibited material on examinations,\n Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n Plagiarizing.\n Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination,\nhomework or laboratory\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee.\nClass Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory.\nAnnouncements\nAnnouncements All announcements will be made on the LMS site for this course. It is your\nresponsibility to keep your e-mail address operative all times. Check your e-mails regularly in order to\nstay informed.\nWeek Assignment Details\n• Name of the project\n• The URL of the project web page\n2 Project Proposal • Names of the team members\n• Names of the supervisor and jury members\n• 1-2 paragraph description of the project\n1.
