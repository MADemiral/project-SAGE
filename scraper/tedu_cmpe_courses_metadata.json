Course attendance will be recorded at each lecture.\nYour attendance level will be assessed by the percentage of the attendance handouts that you have\nsigned.\nHands-On Activities\nYou will be assigned a hands-on activity each week. You are expected to submit your answers to\nhands-on activities (you are expected to upload your answers to Moodle for online sessions, or submit\nyour work for face-to-face lectures). The hands-on activities are ungraded but they will be used to\nassess your active participation in the lectures.\nClass Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory. The material covered in class by your instructors will\nonly provide a fundamental understanding of the general context. If you are willing to effectively learn\na topic, you must actively work on it yourself. Reading is one of the most successful ways of learning\nabout a topic\nMissed Work\nMake ups for midterm and final exams will be provided if the student can provide a legal document\nconfirming a significant health issue at the time of the examination or with the approval of the\ninstructor.\nAssignment Rules\nAll assignment works must be done individually, unless explicitly stated in the homework assignment.\nA student can submit only one work. In case of multiple submissions, only the latest submission will\nbe considered. Students cannot submit work on other students’ behalf.\nLate Assignment Submission\nAssignments are expected to be completed by due date. For every day (24 hrs.) that the assignment\nis late after due date, 20% of the maximum will be deducted from the assignment score. No\nassignments will be accepted once they are four or more days late.\nExtra Credits\nExtra credits will not be provided.\nUse of Tools\nYou may use AI tools such as ChatGPT for allowed parts of the assignments. The allowed use of these\ntools will be announced as part of each assignment handout. It is mandatory to refer to your use of the\n\ntools including the URL, platform, prompt, time and date. You must also include sufficient number\nof screen snapshots of your use of these tools in your report. Otherwise your use will be considered\nas cheating.\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n• turning in someone else's work as your own\n• copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n• failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n• giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n• changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n• copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work,\nwhether you give credit or not” (www.plagiarism.org)\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask for\nthe help of other resources.\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n• Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n• Using prohibited material on examinations,\n• Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n• Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n• Plagiarizing\n• Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n• Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination, homework\nor laboratory\nCheating is also a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee.\n\nCOURSE ASSIGNMENTS\nA. One Midterm Exam [35%]\nClosed-book written exam. The exam will most likely be held in the weekend. The exam hours\nand classrooms will be announced over Moodle.\nB. Programming Assignments [25%]\nThere will be five programming assignments. Each will involve developing a project in Java and\nsubmitting a written report on your work. The weight of each assignment toward the final grade\nwill be specified when the assignments are given.\nZoom meetings will be held to provide detailed information about the project requirements.\nAttendance to these online meetings is not mandatory, but valuable information will be provided\nto help you in your assignments.\nC. Final Exam [40%]\nClosed book exam\nImportant Notes:\nNote 1: A weighted midterm and final exam average of 30 points (out of 100) is required\nto pass this course. Students, who cannot satisfy this condition, will get an automatic F\ngrade.\nFor example, a student who gets:\n28 points (out of 100) from midterm exam;\n32 points (out of 100) from final exam\nwill satisfy this condition and will not get an automatic F : (28 x 35 + 32 x 40)/(35 + 40) = 30.133 > 30.\nHowever, the student may still get an F grade depending on the overall course performance.\nNote 2: To pass the course, a minimum 40/100 weighted grade is required for\nprogramming assignments. Students, who cannot satisfy this condition, will get an\nautomatic F grade.\nThe weighted average of programming assignments is calculated in a similar way to the exam\ngrades, as explained above.\n\nTENTATIVE COURSE OUTLINE\nW Day Topics Readings Assignments\nReview of Algorithms and Data\n1 22.09 – 28.09 Ch.4, Section 4.1\nStructures,\n2 29.09 – 05.10 Undirected Graphs Ch.4, Section 4.1\nAssignment 1:\n3 06.10 - 12.10 Undirected Graphs Ch.4, Section 4.1\n(Undir.

The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask for\nthe help of other resources.\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n• Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n• Using prohibited material on examinations,\n• Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n• Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n• Plagiarizing.\n• Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n• Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination, homework\nor laboratory\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee.\nClass Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory.

Course attendance will be recorded at each lecture.\nYour attendance level will be assessed by the percentage of the attendance handouts that you have\nsigned.\nHands-On Activities\nYou will be assigned a hands-on activity each week. You are expected to submit your answers to\nhands-on activities (you are expected to upload your answers to Moodle for online sessions, or submit\nyour work for face-to-face lectures). The hands-on activities are ungraded but they will be used to\nassess your active participation in the lectures.\nClass Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory. The material covered in class by your instructors will\nonly provide a fundamental understanding of the general context. If you are willing to effectively learn\na topic, you must actively work on it yourself. Reading is one of the most successful ways of learning\nabout a topic\nMissed Work\nMake ups for midterm and final exams will be provided if the student can provide a legal document\nconfirming a significant health issue at the time of the examination or with the approval of the\ninstructor.\nAssignment Rules\nAll assignment works must be done individually, unless explicitly stated in the homework assignment.\nA student can submit only one work. In case of multiple submissions, only the latest submission will\nbe considered. Students cannot submit work on other students’ behalf.\nLate Assignment Submission\nAssignments are expected to be completed by due date. For every day (24 hrs.) that the assignment\nis late after due date, 20% of the maximum will be deducted from the assignment score. No\nassignments will be accepted once they are four or more days late.\nExtra Credits\nExtra credits will not be provided.\nUse of Tools\nYou may use AI tools such as ChatGPT for allowed parts of the assignments. The allowed use of these\ntools will be announced as part of each assignment handout. It is mandatory to refer to your use of the\n\ntools including the URL, platform, prompt, time and date. You must also include sufficient number\nof screen snapshots of your use of these tools in your report. Otherwise your use will be considered\nas cheating.\nPlagiarism\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism:\n• turning in someone else's work as your own\n• copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n• failing to put a quotation in quotation marks\n• giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n• changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\n• copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work,\nwhether you give credit or not” (www.plagiarism.org)\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee. The best way to avoid accidentally plagiarizing is to work on your own before you ask for\nthe help of other resources.\nCheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the\nthings that can be considered as cheating are the following:\n• Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n• Using prohibited material on examinations,\n• Lying to gain any type of advantage in class\n• Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n• Plagiarizing\n• Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n• Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination, homework\nor laboratory\nCheating is also a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary\ncommittee.\n\nCOURSE ASSIGNMENTS\nA. One Midterm Exam [35%]\nClosed-book written exam. The exam will most likely be held in the weekend. The exam hours\nand classrooms will be announced over Moodle.\nB. Programming Assignments [25%]\nThere will be five programming assignments. Each will involve developing a project in Java and\nsubmitting a written report on your work. The weight of each assignment toward the final grade\nwill be specified when the assignments are given.\nZoom meetings will be held to provide detailed information about the project requirements.\nAttendance to these online meetings is not mandatory, but valuable information will be provided\nto help you in your assignments.\nC. Final Exam [40%]\nClosed book exam\nImportant Notes:\nNote 1: A weighted midterm and final exam average of 30 points (out of 100) is required\nto pass this course. Students, who cannot satisfy this condition, will get an automatic F\ngrade.\nFor example, a student who gets:\n28 points (out of 100) from midterm exam;\n32 points (out of 100) from final exam\nwill satisfy this condition and will not get an automatic F : (28 x 35 + 32 x 40)/(35 + 40) = 30.133 > 30.\nHowever, the student may still get an F grade depending on the overall course performance.\nNote 2: To pass the course, a minimum 40/100 weighted grade is required for\nprogramming assignments. Students, who cannot satisfy this condition, will get an\nautomatic F grade.\nThe weighted average of programming assignments is calculated in a similar way to the exam\ngrades, as explained above.\n\nTENTATIVE COURSE OUTLINE\nW Day Topics Readings Assignments\nReview of Algorithms and Data\n1 22.09 – 28.09 Ch.4, Section 4.1\nStructures,\n2 29.09 – 05.10 Undirected Graphs Ch.4, Section 4.1\nAssignment 1:\n3 06.10 - 12.10 Undirected Graphs Ch.4, Section 4.1\n(Undir.

Midterm [25%]\nMidterm exam worth 25% of the overall grade.\nB. Final [35%]\nFinal exam worth 35% of the overall grade.\nC. Quizzes: [15%]\nThere will be 4 quizzes, each will contribute 3,75% towards your overall grade.\nD. Laboratory Works [15%]\nThere will be 5 graded lab activities, each is worth 3% towards your overall grade.\nE. Programming Assignments [10%]\nThere will be 2 programming assignments, each is worth 5% towards your overall grade.\nCOURSE POLICIES\nⅠ. Attendance\nAttendance to the 60% of lectures is mandatory.\nAttendance to the 75% of lab activities is mandatory.\nⅡ. Missed Work\nMake-ups for Midterm and Final exams will be provided if the student can provide a medical document confirming a\nsignificant health issue on the day of the exam. Please be aware that the applicable medical documents are updated.\nThere will be no makeup for quizzes, labs and programming assignments\nⅢ. Extra Credit\nExtra credits will not be offered.\nⅣ. Assignment Rules\nAll assignment works must be done individually. A student can submit only one work. In case of multiple submissions, only\nthe latest submission will be considered. Students cannot submit work on other students’ behalf.\nLate submissions will be penalized by 15% for each day past the deadline.\nⅤ.Plagiarism\n\nAll of the following are considered plagiarism.\n• turning in someone else's work as your own\n• copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit\n• failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.\n• giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation\n• changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving\ncredit\n• copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of\nyour work, whether you give credit or not ( www.plagiarism.org )\n• asking quiz, activity or assignment questions on online places, such as\nstackoverflow.com.\nPlagiarism is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary committee.\nThe students who are involved in any plagiarism activity will be subjected to disciplinary action.\nⅥ. Cheating\nCheating has a very broad description which can be summarized as “acting dishonestly”. Some of the things that can be\nconsidered as cheating are the following:\n• Copying answers on examinations, homework and laboratory works,\n• Using prohibited material on examinations,\n• Lying to gain any type of advantage in class.\n• Providing false, modified or forged data in a report\n• Plagiarizing\n• Modifying graded material to be regraded.\n• Causing harm to colleagues by distributing false information about an examination, homework or laboratory\nCheating is a very serious offense and will be penalized accordingly by the university disciplinary committee.\nⅦ. Class Participation\nIf you do not attend the laboratory and complete the requested tasks, you cannot /will not get the assigned points from the\nlaboratory. By actively participating in class, you can improve your learning process and immediately confirm what you have\nearned and what you have not internalized.\nⅧ. Class Readings\nClass readings are necessary but not mandatory. The material covered in class by your instructor will only provide a\nfundamental understanding of the general context. If you are willing to effectively learn something, you must actively work\non it yourself. Reading is one of the most successful ways of learning about a topic.\nIX. Student Development and Psychological Counseling Center\nStudent Development and Psychological Counseling Centre is mandated with providing crisis intervention and supportive\nlistening services to the campus community. The Center conducts individual counseling, group guidance studies, workshops,\nseminars, and orientation studies for all students in need.
